This project implements and tests four different algorithms: Brute Force Closest Pair, Brute Force Convex Hull,
Divide and Conquer Closest Pair, and Divide and Conquer Convex Hull.

In order to test our algorithm, there will be 20 initial data points randomly generated in the data set.
After the program is initiated, these 20 points will be plotted to the screen.

Afterwards, the user will be able to choose from 5 different commands:
Pressing the 'S' key: Runs the Brute Force Closest Pair Algorithm
Pressing the 'H' key: Runs the Brute Force Convex Hull Algorithm
Pressing the 'C' key: Runs the Divide and Conquer Closest Pair Algorithm
Pressing the 'D' key: Runs the Divide and Conquer Convex Hull Algorithm
Pressing the 'P' key: Prints out the run time tableau of all 4 algorithms

After the chosen command is run, the user has the option to choose from 2 other commands:
Pressing the 'R' key: Plots 20 additional randomly generated points to the data set and reruns the desired algorithm
Pressing the 'MOUSE' click: Generates a point at the mouse click and reruns the desired algorithm
Pressing the 'O' key: Allows you to exit the loop and choose another algorithm to run

To exit the program, press the 'Q' key.
